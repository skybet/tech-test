# Sky Betting & Gaming Technical Test

## Introduction

Welcome to the Sky Betting & Gaming Technical Test!

We hope that you find this exercise fun. There are no trick questions; we want to see your solution to a simple problem with well thought-out and well structured code.


## The Brief

The aim of this exercise is to create a server-side form handler in the language of your choice, to load and save data from our supplied HTML form.

The main functionality required is a simple update capability against the existing records. Other CRUD functions could be added if you have time. In order to validate this functionality, you should include an appropriate level of test coverage.

For a datastore, your application should just read from and write to a file on disk, rather than use a relational/noSQL solution.

We leave it to you to decide how to transmit the data between the client and the server. Any client-side code should maintain the same principles as the server-side code.

You should use engineering best practices where appropriate. Principles we value include: security, performance, readability, testability, scalability, simplicity. You should also aim to achieve a clean separation of concerns between components of your solution; using the MVC pattern, for example.

### The Markup

An example of the initial HTML form is [provided in this repository](markup.html).

## The Deliverable

Replace the contents of this README.md with:

  1. A covering note explaining the technology choices you have made.
  1. Any instructions required to run your solution and tests in a Linux environment.

Email as an attachment or a link the git bundled repository showing your commit history with all your commits on the master branch:

        git bundle create <anything>.bundle --all --branches

## Equality & Diversity

We consider all candidates equally, fairly and without bias.  To that end, we ask that you do not leave any personally identifying information in your submission (such as your name within an author field or file, or in use as test data).  We run all VCS-based submissions through an anonymiser before assessment, so that there is no identifying information in the commit history, but this will only remove references in the committing author and email address, not deep in the code submitted.
